# Rovyl

**One gesture. Any destination.**

A radial launcher for Windows. Hold the middle mouse button anywhere, aim, release.

## Why

Every launcher asks you to stop what you are doing. Open a window, type a few letters,
read a list, pick a row. It is fast, but it is still an interruption — and your hand
leaves the mouse.

Rovyl takes a different bet: **you already know where your things are.** Hold the middle
mouse button and a wheel blooms under your cursor. Move toward what you want. Release.
The whole thing takes less than a second, happens wherever you already were, and never
puts a window between you and your work.

## Features

- **Opens under your cursor** — over any window, including fullscreen apps
- **Launch anything** — applications, folders, files, websites, custom commands
- **Automatic discovery** — reads your Start Menu and extracts real app icons
- **Workspaces** — separate wheels for work, games, streaming; switch with a number key
- **Your trigger** — middle mouse button, a side button, or a global hotkey
- **Two aiming modes** — by direction for speed, or by pointer for precision
- **Focus protection** — stays out of the way while you are in a fullscreen game
- **Fully offline** — no account, no telemetry, no ads, nothing leaves your machine

## Install

**Direct download** — [latest release](https://github.com/arshit09/rovyl/releases/latest).
This is the build to install from this fork: it carries fixes that have not reached the
Store package. Windows will warn about an unsigned installer; the app updates itself from
this repository afterwards.

**From the Microsoft Store** — [apps.microsoft.com](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9N03SVPMXSV1).
Installs and updates automatically with no security warnings, but it is upstream's build,
so it does not include the fixes made here.

**From source** — see [Building](#building) below.

## How it works

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

**Hold**

Press and hold the middle mouse button anywhere in Windows. The wheel appears centred on
your cursor — you never move to reach it.

</td>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

**Aim**

Move toward the shortcut you want. In direction mode the slice you point at lights up from
anywhere on screen; in pointer mode only the icon under the cursor does.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

**Release**

The target opens and the wheel disappears. Release in the centre, or press Escape, to
cancel without launching anything.

</td>
<td valign="top">

**Switch**

Number keys move between workspaces while the wheel is open, or use the picker in the hub.

</tr>

## Building

Requires **Windows 10 or 11** and **Node 20+**. Windows-only by design: the trigger, the
icon pipeline and the window handling all depend on Win32 behaviour.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arshit09/rovyl
cd rovyl
npm install
npm start
```

`npm start` brings up Vite and waits for it before launching Electron. To run the halves
separately, use `npm run dev` and `npm run electron`.

Google sign-in needs credentials of your own — copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and
fill in a client ID from your own Google Cloud project. There is deliberately no default,
so a fork never inherits someone else's OAuth client.

> The dev app and the packaged app share `%APPDATA%\Rovyl`, because Electron derives it
> from `productName`. A dev session therefore reads and writes your real configuration.
> Pass `--user-data-dir` to work against a clean profile.

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `npm start` | Dev server + Electron |
| `npm run dev` | Vite only |
| `npm run electron` | Electron only, waits for port 5173 |
| `npm run build` | `tsc` → Vite build → radial verification → icon generation |

| `npm run dist:store` | `build` + electron-builder, MSIX package for the Store |

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome. Before changing anything that looks arbitrary, read
**[docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)** — most of it exists because something
broke, and the reason is written down.

Two things worth knowing up front: the code comments are in Portuguese and explain *why*
rather than *what*, and `npm run build` runs a verification script that enforces the
window-handshake invariants. If it fails, the handshake was broken, not the test.
